# Alzheimer's Disease Trends from 1999-2018
Hello everyone!! 

Here you will find my Capstone project for Nashville Software School on Alzheimer's Disease trends over the past 20 years. I have a personal attachment to this disease due to it being a true fear of mine and having family members that have had dementia in the later years of their lives. 

This project will be broken down in the following areas: <br>
	1. How AD affects the brain and cognitive ability. <br>
	2. Trends overall in the United States from 1999-2018. <br>
	3. Trends in Tennessee from 1999-2018. <br>
	4. How can you find help if you or someone you love has AD? <br>
	5. Resources <br>
	6. Introduction to what the parts of the brain are, and what they control. <br> 
	

I hope you find this information useful and informative. IF you have any questions, please feel free to message me.
