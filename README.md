# NSSCapstone
Hello everyone!! 

Here you will find my Capstone project for Nashville Software School on Alzheimer's Disease trends over the past 20 years. I have a personal attachment to this disease due to it being a true fear of mine and having family members that have had dementia in the later years of their lives. 

This project will be broken down in the following areas:
	1. Introduction to what Alzheimer's Disease, or AD, is and a brief history. 
	2. How does AD affects the brain and cognitive ability. 
	3. Trends overall in the United States from 1999-2018
	4. Trends in Tennessee specifically from 1999-2018
	5. Caregiving trends and statistics
	6. How can you find help if you or someone you love has AD?
	7. Resources
	8. Bibliography and Sources

I hope you find this information useful and informative. IF you have any questions, please feel free to message me.
